# Ray Tracing in one weekend

This is an implementation of [Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) in Rust.

## Preview of the final image converted to PNG

## To recreate the output image run:

`$ cargo run > img.ppm`

### Scenes:

The code contains few prebuilt scenes.
You can render them by calling the appropriate function in main.

## Extra improvemnts added beyond the book:

- Added rayon for parallel execution
